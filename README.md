# 🎧 Circular Audio Visualizer (Frontend Only)

This is a **frontend-only audio visualizer** that turns sound into a circular animation.

No backend.  
No servers.  
No data leaving your browser.

Just sound → visuals → vibes ✨

## 🔊 What’s Inside?

- 🎤 Captures microphone input using the browser

Speak, clap, sing, or play music — it reacts instantly.

2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser

## 🤓 Why This Exists

I made this to:
- Learn how audio works in the browser
- Experiment with real-time visuals
- Build something fun and interactive
- Avoid frameworks (for once)

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Works best in Chrome / Edge
- Microphone permission is required
- Audio is processed locally — nothing is recorded or sent anywhere

---

## ✨ Ideas for Later (Maybe)

- Color changes based on frequency
- Glow or neon effects
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Custom themes

## 📸 Demo

If it moves when you talk, it’s working.  
If it doesn’t… check your mic 😄
